*All-in-one funding for online sellers – fast loans up to $1M plus daily marketplace payouts.*

![SellersFunding (SellersFi) Screenshot](image/sellersfi.webp)

SellersFunding, now branded as SellersFi, focuses on the financial needs of marketplace sellers (Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc.). They have deployed over **$1 billion to 30,000+ e-commerce sellers** since 2017. Their core offerings include:

- **Working Capital loans:** Borrow $5K to $1M for 3-24 month terms, often approved in 48 hours. There’s no impact on your credit when checking eligibility.
- **Daily Payouts:** Instead of waiting weeks for Amazon to pay, SellersFi’s Instant Pay can advance you ~80-90% of yesterday’s sales **the next day**, smoothing cash flow.
- **Global Seller Tools:** They also offer an International Wallet for collecting multi-currency sales and a prepaid card to use funds.

**Why it stands out:** SellersFi was built by understanding that online sellers often get rejected by banks.

## [Uncapped](https://www.weareuncapped.com)
*Founder-friendly growth capital from $100K up to $5M in 24–48h, with flat fees.*

![Uncapped Screenshot](image/weareuncapped.webp)

Uncapped is a UK-based fintech offering **non-dilutive financing** to online businesses in Europe and the US. It’s ideal for high-growth brands that need six or seven-figure infusions fast – for example, to stock up for a busy season or ramp up advertising. You can get between $100,000 and $2,000,000 in as little as two days (larger amounts available for very high revenue clients).

- **Simple pricing:** Rather than interest, Uncapped charges a flat fee on the capital provided. You know the full cost upfront and repay through a revenue share until that fixed fee is met. No hidden charges or compounding interest.
- **No equity, no personal guarantee:** As the name implies, there’s no cap on your potential – you don’t give up equity and aren’t risking personal assets. They won’t ask for personal guarantees or credit checks.
- **Tailored to you:** Uncapped has tiered options depending on your size. For instance, if you’re a smaller seller (~$10K monthly revenue), they have a starter program for Amazon sellers. Bigger brand doing $500K+ a month? They can set up a rolling line of credit. This personalization, along with a dedicated account manager, ensures the funding fits your business needs.

## [Settle](https://www.settle.com)
*Cash flow management via supplier payment financing – **buy now, pay later** for inventory.*

![Settle Screenshot](image/settle.webp)

Settle takes a slightly different approach to eCommerce financing: it helps you **pay your suppliers upfront** and then gives you extended terms to repay Settle. In practice, you upload your vendor invoices to Settle – they’ll pay your supplier immediately, and you pay Settle back in 30, 60, or 120 days (your choice). It’s like getting supplier credit, even if your vendors demand cash on delivery.

- **Improve relationships & terms:** By paying suppliers quickly (with Settle’s money), you can often negotiate better pricing or secure stock that would otherwise require full prepayment. Settle’s service essentially **turns your payables into flexible financing**, boosting your purchasing power.
- **Easy bill management:** The platform also acts as a central hub for your outgoing payments. You can manage and schedule all vendor payments, so it doubles as a bookkeeping aid.
- **Great for growing DTC brands:** If you’re scaling and need a lot of inventory upfront, cash can get tight. Settle ensures you don’t miss out on big orders due to timing of cash flows. There’s a flat fee for the extended term, and you choose when to pay back within the agreed period – no hidden surprises.

## [Kickfurther](https://www.kickfurther.com)
*Inventory financing through a unique consignment crowdfunding model – pay as products sell.*

![Kickfurther Screenshot](image/kickfurther.webp)

Kickfurther isn’t a typical lender; it’s a platform where a community of backers funds your inventory, and you repay them as that inventory sells. Essentially, **Kickfurther will purchase your inventory for you** and you buy it back over time (plus a fee) once you’ve sold it. This model can be a game-changer for physical product brands (especially CPG or retail goods) that need to stock up on more units but want to avoid traditional debt.

- **Crowd-powered capital:** You list a “Co-Op” on Kickfurther describing how much inventory you need and the profit margin you’ll share. Thousands of users can contribute to fund your purchase order, typically within a short window.
- **Flexible repayment:** Because it’s consignment, you generally only pay back as you move units. This aligns the financing with your sales velocity – **no large fixed monthly payments** when sales are slow. If your inventory sells faster, you pay the co-op back faster (and the funders earn their profit sooner).
- **Founder-friendly:** It’s non-dilutive (no equity taken) and often cheaper than high-interest loans. For many small brands, it’s also a way to build a community of backers who are literally invested in your success. Kickfurther works best for products with proven sales that need capital to scale up inventory for big retail or eCommerce demand spikes.

## [Payability](https://www.payability.com)
*Instant cash flow for marketplace sellers: daily payouts and advances up to $250K.*

![Payability Screenshot](image/payability.webp)

Payability offers two main financing products to **boost marketplace sellers’ cash flow**: **Instant Access** and **Instant Advance**. If you sell on Amazon, Shopify, Newegg, etc., Instant Access allows you to get paid **the next day for your sales** (instead of waiting weeks for the marketplace’s payment cycle). Typically, Payability advances you 80% of yesterday’s sales daily, and releases the remaining 20% when the platform’s payout comes through. This steady cash stream helps you reinvest in inventory or ads continuously.

Instant Advance, on the other hand, is like a merchant cash advance: a lump sum of up to around $250,000 based on your future sales, which you can get in as fast as 24 hours. It’s great for a larger investment need (e.g. buying holiday inventory in bulk) without waiting to accumulate revenue.

- **No credit checks:** Approval is based on your store’s health (sales history, account metrics) rather than personal credit. Payability is friendly to smaller sellers who have steady sales but little financing history.
- **Quick and convenient:** Setup is straightforward – link your marketplace accounts. Many Amazon sellers use Payability to solve the two-week payout delay **so they never run out of stock due to cash crunches**. The fees are transparent (a small percentage for daily advances, or a flat fee for lump sums).
- **Ideal for marketplace entrepreneurs:** If you rely on platforms with slow payouts (Amazon, Walmart, etc.), Payability essentially gives you a rolling advance so you can keep the growth momentum. It’s like getting paid in real-time for your online sales, which can be a huge competitive advantage.

## [Outfund](https://out.fund)

They provide **offers within 24 hours** thanks to automated data analysis, and you can draw anywhere from £10K to £10M of capital as needed.

- **Straightforward repayments:** You repay Outfund through a flexible percentage of your monthly revenue. Unlike fixed loans, if revenue dips one month, your payment shrinks accordingly – preserving cash when you need it.
- **Multi-country support:** They operate in the UK, Europe, U.S., and Australia, among others. This is useful if you’re expanding internationally; Outfund understands various markets and can continue funding as you grow cross-border.

Notably, Yardline can offer very large advances (even seven or eight figures) to power big growth moves.

- **Growth-centric approach:** Yardline was acquired by Thrasio (the big Amazon brand aggregator) early on, so they really understand the needs of FBA and marketplace businesses. Beyond funding, they offer advisory on how to optimize your business for profitability and eventual sale. It’s a bit like getting a growth partner alongside the money.
- **Flexible repayment:** They typically use a revenue share model (a portion of your sales) or a fixed plan depending on what makes sense for your situation. The idea is to not overburden you when sales are slower, similar to other RBFs.
- **Partner friendly:** Yardline has a partner directory and works with eCommerce service providers, which can benefit merchants via referrals to trusted tools or agencies. If you’re a marketplace seller aiming to level up quickly – maybe to become an attractive acquisition target or simply outpace competitors – Yardline’s hefty funding capability and industry know-how make it a top pick.

They typically fund amounts from €10K to €5M, which companies repay via a share of monthly revenue.

- **Marketing budget focus:** One unique eligibility criterion is having a marketing budget above €10k – Viceversa often positions its funding to be used specifically for customer acquisition (like fueling your Facebook/Google Ads). They invest in your marketing campaigns on the premise that increased spend will drive higher revenues to repay the advance.
- **Pan-European reach:** They work with businesses across EU countries. If you’re incorporated anywhere in Europe with 6+ months of online sales history, you can apply. This broad approach is great for EU startups that might not fit the criteria of UK or US-based funders.
- **Founders first:** Like others, no equity or guarantees required. Viceversa’s model aligns with your success – they grow when you grow. It’s a solid choice for European founders looking for a partner to scale marketing and subscriptions without giving up a stake in the company.

They highlight supporting **brands selling on Shopify, Amazon, and other online channels**, with a special focus on those investing heavily in marketing.

- **Use of funds:** Many Spanish and Latin American eCommerce entrepreneurs use Ritmo to front-load marketing spend – essentially **turning ad spend into a revenue-share expense** rather than a sunk cost. If your ROI on ads is good, this can dramatically accelerate your growth without cash flow strain.
- **International expansion:** Ritmo has also expanded to Latin America, so it’s a good option if you operate in Spanish-speaking markets. With backing from major banks and firms, it’s one of the more robust players in the EU scene ensuring you have capital when you need it, and flexible repayments when you don’t.

- **Fair criteria:** To qualify, a business should be operational at least 6 months and making €10k+ in monthly revenue. These criteria ensure you’re established enough, but they don’t demand profitability or a pristine credit score – growth trajectory matters more.
- **Products:** Silvr offers both revenue-based advances and more traditional term loans, giving some flexibility in how you structure repayment. But either way, no equity loss and no personal guarantee.
- **Growth insights:** An interesting perk – Silvr provides a dashboard with insights into your key metrics (CAC, LTV, etc.), gleaned from the accounts you connected.

Divibank is a fintech from Brazil that provides **revenue-based financing to startups and SMEs**, enabling them to scale without venture capital. Since launching in 2020, Divibank has been helping companies finance digital marketing and inventory based on projected revenue streams. The model is straightforward: you get a cash infusion now and repay it with a percentage of future sales until a fixed return is met.

- **Empowering entrepreneurs:** In Brazil’s dynamic market, many great businesses are still under-served by banks. Divibank addresses this by looking at your real business metrics (online sales, ad performance) rather than just credit scores. If your campaigns generate revenue, they’ll fund you to amplify that.
- **Focus on marketing ROI:** Divibank often mentions funding for performance marketing – essentially giving you the budget to acquire customers now and pay back later from the sales those customers generate. It’s an appealing proposition for growing DTC brands and apps that can predict the revenue from ad spend.
- **Transparent and tech-driven:** Applications are online; decisions are relatively quick for the region (think days, not the weeks or months a bank loan can take). For Brazilian companies (and Latin America broadly) looking to harness alternative financing, Divibank stands out as a local, tech-savvy partner that speaks your language and understands your growth ambitions.

## **FAQ: Common Questions about eCommerce Funding Platforms**

**Q1: Do these eCommerce funding platforms require me to give up equity or personal collateral?**
**A1:** No – the beauty of these platforms is that they offer *non-dilutive* capital. You’re not giving away shares in your business, and typically no personal guarantees are needed. Approval and repayment are based on your business’s revenue performance, not your personal assets or credit score.

**Q2: How fast can I get funding for my online business?**
**A2:** It’s much quicker than traditional financing. Many providers can approve and fund within 1-3 days once you connect your data. For instance, **8fig** often gives a funding offer in ~24 hours, and others like Wayflyer or Clearco aren’t far behind. This means you can seize time-sensitive opportunities (a flash sale, a bulk inventory buy) without waiting weeks for a loan.

**Q3: Which funding platform is best for a new or small seller?**
**A3:** It depends on your revenue size and needs. If you’re relatively small (say under $20K monthly sales), options like **Payability** (for daily payouts) or **Booste** (micro-funding up to $25K) are tailored for you. As you grow into mid-size, platforms like **8fig** or **Onramp Funds** can scale funding into the millions to support your expansion. Always check each provider’s minimum requirements – some have revenue thresholds to qualify.
